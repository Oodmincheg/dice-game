# dice-game

Rules are easy. Roll the dice and get score. If you push 'hold-on' score'll be fix into global score and another player start. If dice's one your current score 
turn to zero and your opponent plays. If you get two sixes a row ALL YOU SCORE turns to zero. you can put number for win into input field on 
on the top of the screen. Good luck

p.s. sorry for my english.
